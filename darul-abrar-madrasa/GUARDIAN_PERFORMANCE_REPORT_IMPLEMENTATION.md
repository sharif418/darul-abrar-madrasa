   - Test responsive design on mobile devices

## Features Implemented

- Subject Performance Analysis
- Attendance Summary
- Fee Status
- Teacher Remarks
- Personalized Recommendations

### Export Options
- ✅ PDF Download (DomPDF)
- ✅ Email Delivery (Laravel Mail)

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Used
- `App\Repositories\ResultRepository` - For academic data
- `App\Repositories\AttendanceRepository` - For attendance data
- `Barryvdh\DomPDF\Facade\Pdf` - For PDF generation
- `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail` - For email delivery
- `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log` - For error logging

### Data Structure
```php
[
    'reportType' => 'term|annual',
    'dateRange' => ['start' => Carbon, 'end' => Carbon],
    'academicPerformance' => [
        'examResults' => Collection,
        'totalExams' => int,
        'averageGpa' => float,
        'passRate' => float,
        'bestSubject' => array,
        'weakestSubject' => array,
        'subjectPerformance' => Collection
    ],
    'attendanceSummary' => [
        'overall' => array,
        'term' => array,
        'records' => Collection
    ],
    'feeStatus' => [
        'fees' => Collection,
        'totalFees' => float,
        'paidAmount' => float,
        'pendingAmount' => float,
        'paymentStatus' => string
    ],
    'teacherRemarks' => Collection,
    'recommendations' => array
]
```

### Recommendation Logic
- Low attendance (< 75%) → High priority
- Low GPA (< 2.5) → High priority
- Pending fees → Medium priority
- Weak subject performance (< 2.0 GPA) → Medium priority
- Excellent performance (GPA ≥ 3.5 & attendance ≥ 90%) → Positive reinforcement

## Next Steps

1. Create web view (`performance-report.blade.php`)
2. Create PDF view (`performance-report-pdf.blade.php`)
3. Create email template (`emails/performance-report.blade.php`)
4. Add navigation links in child profile and dashboard
5. Test all functionality
6. Document usage for guardians

## Notes

- Following existing patterns from ResultController and FeeController for PDF generation
- Using established guardian authorization pattern
- Comprehensive error handling with logging
- Date range filtering applied to all data sources
- Recommendations are dynamically generated based on performance metrics
