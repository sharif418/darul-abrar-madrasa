## Health Metrics Collected

### 1. Data Integrity Checks
| Metric | Description | Detection Method |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Missing Role Records | Users without corresponding table records | `User::hasRoleRecord()` |
| Orphaned Records | Role records without users | `whereNotIn()` queries |
| Total Missing | Sum of all missing records | Aggregation |
| Total Orphaned | Sum of all orphaned records | Aggregation |

### 2. Spatie Role Sync Status
| Metric | Description | Detection Method |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Missing Spatie Roles | Users without Spatie role assignment | `User::with('roles')` filter |
| Mismatched Roles | Wrong Spatie role assigned | Role comparison logic |
| Migration Progress | Percentage with Spatie roles | `User::has('roles')` count |

### 3. Database Statistics
| Metric | Description | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Users by Role | Count per role type | `User::where('role')` |
| Active/Inactive | Status breakdown | `User::where('is_active')` |
| Role Record Counts | Total per role table | `Model::count()` |

### 4. Health Score Algorithm
```
Total Issues = Missing + Orphaned + Missing Spatie + Mismatched Spatie
Health % = 100 - ((Total Issues / Total Users) * 100)

Thresholds:
- Excellent: 100%
- Good: 95-99%
- Warning: 85-94%
- Critical: < 85%
```
